Container image registry can be a collection of trash since it is mostly used for service deployment at the time that mostly later will be not used anymore and the total in terms of size will be increasing gradually. Turns out we pay something that we not used anymore
 
So this tools can help you create a rotation mechanism for it, by using the powerful include and exclude filters thanks to [antonmedâ€™s expr](github.com/antonmedv/expr), also it becomes the key difference compared to other existing tools. This is the sample of the command with following criteria for deletion:

- more than 6 months since it's uploaded with size more than 100 MiB
- ignore any repo by name containing with `base-image` for latest tag
- ignore any repo by name containing `internal-tool` for any tag.

```
./cir-rotator delete --service-account sa.json -ho asia.gcr.io/parent-repo \
                     --if "Now() - UploadedAt >= Duration('6M')  and ImageSize >= SizeStr('100 MiB')" \
                     --ef "Repository matches '.*base-image$' and 'latest' in Tag" \
                     --ef "Repository matches '.*internal-tools.*'"
```

## Features

- Supporting various image registry, since even it's complies to [registry spec](https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/api/) in fact some of them provide more attribute(s) in providing various information (eg: size, child repo, etc). At the moment it's supported GCR (Google Container Registry).
- Various auth methods. service account file or the basic auth one (username & password).
- Include filters, set the criteria of the image that will be involved. It can be complex by using any combination such as regex, duration comparison, etc. See the `Filter` section above for more details.
- Exclude filters, same as `Include filter` but it's used as reversed so you can ignore some image to be excluded.
- Output json, dump the result as a json file for any further inspection.
- Output table, show the result in human readable format in cli's stdout.
- Skip some images, this can be useful if you want to ignore the image that is still being in K8S cluster by dumping it then passing the list file to the argument.


## Install

### Container

The image has been uploaded in docker hub, this is the sample how to run it.
```
docker run --rm -it iomarmochtar/cir-rotator  list -u _token -p $(gcloud auth print-access-token) -ho asia.gcr.io/parent-repo --output-table
```

### Binary File

The static binary file under [release page](https://github.com/iomarmochtar/cir-rotator/releases)

## Provider/Type

### Google Container Image

To make it minimal in granted roles for service accounts so i prevent using [list of repository catalog](https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/api/#listing-repositories). As an alternative it will recursively fetch the repository list through any `child` from most top repository.

The minimum role for execute the deletion in registry is `storage.admin` see the details in it's [documentation page](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/access-control#permissions_and_roles)

## Filters

Filter can be set more than one to make it more specific, it divided into 2 kinds: `include` (`--include-filter` or `--if`) and `exclude` (`--exclude-filter` or `--ef`) followed by the filter string pattern. Please note that:

-  `include` filters will be executed first.
- If it's provided more than one filter then it will be grouped with `OR` operation.
- See `expr`'s [language definition](https://github.com/antonmedv/expr/blob/master/docs/Language-Definition.md) for available syntax.

There are also some custom function available:
- `SizeStr(string): float64`, Convert the IEC size unit so it can be operated to `ImageSize` field eg: `SizeStr('10 MiB')`.
- `Date(string): time.Time`, convert the given date string by format `yyyy-mm-dd` to `Time` object eg: `Date("2022-06-13")`.
- `Duration(string): time.Duration`, convert string to golang's duration. see [this page](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) for the supported pattern. but i added some custom one: `d` for day, `M` for month (30 days) and `Y` for year (365 days) eg: `Duration('1Y3M20m')`.

## How To Use

### List Repositories

listing repositories, can be used to examine the target of the repository that will be deleted. It must specified one of the output stdout stable (`--output-table`) and/or dump the result to json file (`--output-json`)

```
</details>

### Delete Repositories

Deleting the repository. if not specified the filters it will **deleting all repositories inside registry**, so better for you to examine first using `list` command or use option `--dry-run`.
